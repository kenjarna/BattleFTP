Here is a longer description of this module, containing some
commentary:
	This module creates and controls all items in the game. It will be used to create
	different classes of items (weapons, shields, armor, etc.), the different items
	in each class, and assign attrbutes to each of these items. We will also create and
	maintain the UI storage of items. This module is mainly opaque with many methods to 
	be used by other teams.
